Introduction: (Scene 1 & 2)
Hello! Thank you for signing up and participating in our Under The Sea Virtual Reality simulation. We appreciate the time you have set aside for this experience. In our simulation there are many things to explore using our incredible submarine including various forms of coral, fish and sea creatures. The Virtual Reality experiment will lead the player under the water and if you are uncomfortable with this, please notify personnel now before starting the experience 






Perfect. We can now continue into an explanation of what we are going to be doing today. Let me introduce myself. My name is Alex and I will be your guide as you venture into this Virtual Reality simulation. Together, we will encounter a new underwater biome filled with exciting audio and visual experiences. You will travel in a submarine that will be remote controlled using the buttons in front of you. I will give you a summary of what we will be doing as you explore the biome. As you see, we begin on an island where we will first start with a breathing exercise which will last approximately 1 to 2 minutes. After the breathing exercise, we will venture out under water and explore what the biome has to offer. Overall, the experience should last about 5 to 10 minutes. Once you have completed all the exercises and roamed, you will then be asked to conclude the exercise while additional personnel help you take off the rest of the Virtual Reality equipment. Additionally, after you have removed all equipment a post VR survey will be provided to you. The survey is similar to the pre survey. Please read all questions carefully before answering. After the post survey, you will be all set and free to leave.
Now that we have gone over what we will be doing today. We can now continue to the first activity.
