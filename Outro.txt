Outro:
Thank you for your participation. Unfortunately, your remainder of time with us is coming to an end. Please wrap up your last interaction and make your way towards the island from which you spawned. We appreciate your willingness to cooperate and make the time for us. Please make your way back to the island and prepare to take off the VR equipment. If you are unsure how to take off the headset, surrounding personnel shall assist you in taking off the gear. But we hope you have enjoyed the simulation. Please do not forget to complete the post VR survey which will be handed to you shortly. Have a good rest of your day.
