Scene 1: Directions
Thank you for going through the breathing exercise with me. I hope you enjoyed it. But now that we have completed the breathing exercise, you can now use the remaining time to explore the biome and roam. I will notify you again once you have reached the duration of the experiment. Happy roaming!
